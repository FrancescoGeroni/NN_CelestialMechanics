# Neural Network for Celestial Mechanics
The goal is that of improving the capabilites of existing IOD techniques (in particular for early asteroid characterization). 
With the mindset of exploring new promising technologies, we'll use a Physical-Informed Neural Network (PINN) where only weights in the last layer are trained (PIELM). We also want to handle inputs of different scales and magnitudes, therefore a particular data-normalization technique has been used.

Work in progress...
