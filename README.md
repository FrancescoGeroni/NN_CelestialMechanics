# Neural Networks for Celestial Mechanics
The goal is that of improving the capabilites of existing IOD (Initial Orbital Determination) techniques, in particular for early asteroid characterization, with the mindset of exploring new promising technologies.
In order to do this we'll use a Physical-Informed Neural Network (PINN) where only weights in the last layer are trained (PIELM) (refs).
We also want to handle inputs of different scales and magnitudes (orbital elements for example), therefore a particular data-normalization technique has been used (ref).

Work in progress...
