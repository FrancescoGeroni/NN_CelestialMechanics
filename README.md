# Neural Network for Celestial Mechanics

The goal is that of improving the capabilities of existing IOD techniques (in particular for early asteroid characterization). 
With the mindset of exploring new promising technologies, we use a Physical-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and (in the near future) a variation where only weights in the last layer are trained (PIELM).
We also have to handle inputs of different scales and magnitudes, therefore a particular data-normalization technique has to be used.
