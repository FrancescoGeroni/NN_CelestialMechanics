    "# NEO Data Fetching and Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a production-ready pipeline to fetch, parse, validate and process data for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) from the [NeoDyS-2](https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/) service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is organized into three main sections:\n",
    "1.  **Configuration & Imports:** Sets the number of objects to process (`N_OBJECTS`) and imports all necessary libraries.\n",
    "2.  **Helper Functions:** Contains all the functions for fetching, parsing, and processing the data.\n",
    "3.  **Execution Pipeline:** Runs the main logic to fetch the object list, verify data, process the objects, and export the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is a single CSV file named `DataSet_NEO_VSA.csv` containing the processed data for the specified number of objects."
